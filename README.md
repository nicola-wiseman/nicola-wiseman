- My research focuses on biological and solubility pump contributions to the global carbon cycle using ML
- My research interests include:
  - Ecological stoichiometry
  - Biological and Carbonate pumps
  - Iron cycling
  - Anthropogenic impacts on the biological pump
  - Global carbon cycling over long-term timescales
